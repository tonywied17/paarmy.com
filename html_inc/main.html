    <h2>Welcome Recruit</h2>
    <p style="text-indent: 1em;">The Pennsylvania Army is a non-historically accurate European / North American community. We do private events on the weekend, ranging from line battles to normal skirmishes. We are a lax regiment in regards to attendance, but serious when it comes
        to gameplay.</p>

    <p style="text-indent: 1em;">Why should you join us? We aren’t special in regards to anyone else, same events, same days, but we have a unique and crazy playstyle, and we have an amazing community with an interesting mix of your average epic gamer, to military veterans and in-service
        members.

    <p>Come join the other Irish Brigade!</p>
